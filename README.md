The user lands on the page that contains the user's saved books. The user can click "Search Books" to search thousands of books through the GoogleBools API. If a book seems interesting, the user may save it by clicking "save" in the search results. The user's preferred books are then saved to a MongoDB database.

The user can return to the "saved books" page to view all saved books from the MongoDB. From the "saved books" page, the user can remove the book, or click "Learn More" to learn more about the book via the GoogleAPI summary.
